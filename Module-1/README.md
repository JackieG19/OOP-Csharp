**Creating Classes:**
- A class is a programming construct that you can use to define your own custom types. 
- When creating a class, you are effectively creating a blueprint for the type.
- The class defines the behaviors and characteristics, or class members, which are shared by 
all instances of the class. These behaviors and characteristics by defining 
methods, fields, properties, and events within the class

**Instantiating Classes:**
- A class is just a blueprint for a type. To use the behaviors and characteristics 
that define within a class, need to create instances of the class. 
An instance of a class is called an object.

**Encapsulation:**
- First pillar of object-oriented programming, encapsulation can be used to 
describe the accessibility of the members belonging to a class or struct.

**Using Properties:**
- As a part of encapsulation, you should consider using properties in your class files. 
- Properties enable you to permit users of the class a means of getting and setting values for the private member data fields within your class. 
- Properties accomplish while hiding implementation or verification code that you may have written inside the property. 

**Constructors:**
- A constructor that takes no parameters is known as the default constructor. 
- This constructor is called whenever someone instantiates your class without providing any arguments.
