----------------- Implicit and Explicit Implementation -------------------

To implement an interface implicitly, you implement each interface member with a signature that matches
the member definition in the interface. To implement an interface explicitly, you fully qualify each member
name so that it is clear that the member belongs to a particular interface.

The following example shows an explicit implementation of the IBeverage interface:

// Implementing an Interface Explicitly
public class Coffee : IBeverage
{
   private int servingTempWithoutMilk { get; set; }
   private int servingTempWithMilk { get; set; }
   public int IBeverage.GetServingTemperature(bool includesMilk)
   {
      if(includesMilk)
      {
          return servingTempWithMilk;
      }
      else
      {
         return servingTempWithoutMilk;
      }
   }
   public bool IBeverage.IsFairTrade { get; set; }
   // Other non-interface members.
}
