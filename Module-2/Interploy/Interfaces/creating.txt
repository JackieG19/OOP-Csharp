------------- Creating Interfaces --------------

 The syntax for defining an interface is similar to the syntax for defining a class.

You use the interface keyword to declare an interface, as shown by the following example:

// Declaring an Interface
public interface IBeverage
{
  // Methods, properties, events, and indexers go here.
}

Similar to a class declaration, an interface declaration can include an access modifier.
You can use the following access modifiers in your interface declarations:

Access modifier: Description

public: The interface is available to code running in any assembly.
internal: The interface is available to any code within the same assembly, but not available to code in
          another assembly. This is the default value if you do not specify an access modifier.
